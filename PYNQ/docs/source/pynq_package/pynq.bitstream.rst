pynq.bitstream Module
=====================

The pynq.pl module facilitates the bitstream class to be used on the 
Programmable Logic (PL). The Bitstream class manages downloading of bitstreams
onto the PL. It converts the bit files into bin files and leverages the FPGA
manager framework to download them onto the PL. It handles full bitstreams
and partial bitstreams. It also manages the device tree segment associated
with each full or partial bitstream.
